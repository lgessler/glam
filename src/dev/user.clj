  ;; For shadow: start the shadow-cljs server using ./scripts/start-dev.sh
  ;; start a cljs repl once shadow is listening (port 9000, default)
  ;; then you can start the watch processes here (ensure the cljs repl has focus in cursive):
  ;;

  ;; You have to start the node server first.
  ;; in terminal, run: node target/node-server.js
  (shadow/repl :node-server)
  ;; now you can send cljs forms to the repl but you'll need to open another cljs repl
  ;; as the server has captured output.
